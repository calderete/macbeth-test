## MacBethChamp

This program will tell you how many times any word occurres in a text file. Hitting 'enter' will tell you what the second most common word in the file is.

For fun there is also a palindrome tester, type the name of the .txt file you wish to test and it will list all palindromes with 3 or more letters.

### To run in the terminal uncomment lines 52 and 53 of 'macbeth_champ.rb' and then run ```ruby macbeth_champ.rb``` and follow the prompts
